# KExploiter
A perl script to list availables exploits for Linux Kernels.

## About
The script grabs the Linux Kernel release version, and return a list of possible exploits (most of them at exploit-db.com, for now). This is fancy script that avoid you to research and find specific exploits for specific kernel versions. The exploit list is added manually so maybe a day it will be deprecated or outdate, feel free to send a pull request with changes and updated list, I will be glad to merge it.

## Usage example

Search exploits for the kernel installed on your system:

```
./Kexploiter.pl
```

Search Kernel exploits for 2.4.6 version:

```
./Kexploiter.pl -k 2.4.6
```
